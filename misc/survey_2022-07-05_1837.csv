However, I see that this is colour coded. Are there enough colours for maaaaany potential selections? How can I unselect cells that have been selected? (In Firefox) When I click and pan the mouse, the current selections disappears. When I then click again somewhere, the previous selection appears again. Might be a bug. ","5","4","1","","Since I am not from the field of neuroscience, this idea might be stupid, but when I see the tool is think that it -- more precisely, specific well-expressive selections with well-accepted colour maps -- could become some kind of standard for communicating what was researched in a e.g. paper. I imagine many people publishing papers and all of them come with small screenshots of some stratification matrices, and the experienced reader knows kind of preattentively what is roughly going on. Could be a great tool for that. Maybe this bold aim could be kept in mind for further development."
